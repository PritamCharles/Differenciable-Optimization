## About The Project

This is a mathematics project, dealing with differentiable optimizations.

On this repository, you can find elements to build. There is also codes to build levels card chart for the Rosenbrock function and some functions about the gradient and the Hessian.

WARNING : Only IPSA students in my group can contribute to this project.
